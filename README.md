Remember It! is a Chrome Extension for Todo list activites. The idea is a simple todo application where the user can type his/her todo item in the input area of the Extension. Usually when a person is browsing, there may be few things that pop up in his/her head about the tasks he/she must do. I, for one would instantly forget what was that task thinking I will remember it later. So this extension is useful where you can put that task in the todo application and it will be saved until you remove it. Apart from this, on clicking options (Right click the extension) you get to see a table with the current todo items, the Website URL and the Website Title. This Website details are mainly to remember the task better. It is similar to backtracking to that particular moment when you thought about the task so that it can be better remembered.
